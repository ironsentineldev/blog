Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) is a powerful feature in Azure SQL Database that helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access by masking it in query results. This is especially useful for preventing non-privileged users from viewing confidential information while still allowing them to perform essential database operations.

### What is Dynamic Data Masking?

[Dynamic Data Masking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/dynamic-data-masking-overview?view=azuresql) automatically obfuscates data in the result set of a query. For instance, if you have a column with credit card numbers, you can mask the data so that users only see a portion of the number, while the rest is replaced with a masking character like `X`.

### Implementing Dynamic Data Masking

Let’s walk through an example using the `Sales.CreditCard` table from the AdventureWorks database on an Azure Managed SQL Instance.

1. **Identify the Columns to Mask**

   Start by identifying which columns contain sensitive data. In this case, let’s say we want to mask the `CardNumber` column.

2. **Apply a Masking Rule**

   You can add a masking rule to the `CardNumber` column with a simple SQL command:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Sales.CreditCard
   ALTER COLUMN CardNumber ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'partial(0,"XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-",4)');
  ```
   This masks the middle digits of the credit card number, displaying only the last four digits.

3. **Test the Masking**

   Now, when a user without the appropriate privileges queries the CardNumber column, they’ll see something like this:

   ```sql
   SELECT CardNumber FROM Sales.CreditCard;
   ```

   Result:

   ```sql
   XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234
   ```

   The actual card number is masked, but authorized users can still perform queries without seeing the full number.

 4. **Managing Masking Permissions**

   By default, database administrators and other highly privileged roles can see unmasked data. To prevent a user from viewing unmasked data, you need to ensure they don't have the UNMASK permission:

   ```sql
   REVOKE UNMASK ON DATABASE::AdventureWorks2019 FROM [User];
   ```

   Dynamic Data Masking is a straightforward and effective way to protect sensitive information in your Azure Managed SQL Instances. It’s easy to implement and can help you meet compliance requirements by ensuring that non-privileged users can’t see confidential data. Give it a try to enhance the security of your databases!
